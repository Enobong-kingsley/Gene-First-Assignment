<h1>My First Webpage</h1>

<h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>

    <p>
        This is my first paragraph in my mew Webpage. This is going to be great.
        I am so excited I can hardly contain <strong>myself.</strong>
        Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>

    <p>
        Yes, that's right - web pages are a lot of fun. Learning how to create web pages is easy and 
        <strong>entertaining.</strong> This is my second paragraph. I hope you like it.
