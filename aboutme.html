<h1>Enobong Ndedde</h1>
<p>
    I am a student of the University of Nigeria, Currently studying computer science. When I first started out in the industry, I did not have a lot of technical knowledge. I thought I would pick it up along the way, but after a couple months in the field, I realized I needed to make some changes if I wanted to be able to progress in my career. That is when I decided to pursue a certified development program for developers held around my community.
    With this type of program I was able to learn, not just learn but connect to like minds and set a deadline for my learning to perfection. 
    I looked at the courses I needed to take and created a detailed schedule. Thanks to the small goals I had set along the way and the schedule I had created, 
    I was able to get better in a short period of time, and also got even more advanced. Yes!!! I AM <strong>Enobong Ndedde</strong> and I am an enthusiastic mobile software developer with a couple of experience .A software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems using various programming languages.
    As from now i would be undergoing a few month program with <strong>GENESYS COMMUNITY</strong> in order to enhance my knowledge in Web Development. Thank You!
